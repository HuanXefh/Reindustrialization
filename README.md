<h1> Reindustrialization </h1>
<p> What if metals in Mindustry are the actual counterparts in real life? What if I make a mod revovling around realistic production instead of tower defense? What if Mindustry gets more educational? </p>
<p> That's why I end up making this mod, to present you a hardcore GregTech-style experience (or kinda torture). </p>

<p> Reindustrialization (Reind in short) is a mod mainly done by myself. It is not yet another mod extending vanilla gameplay, but a mod for someone who enjoys manufacturing all kind of stuffs. Reind is inspired by GTNH, a Minecraft tech modpack, but more by real processes. </p>
<p> No regular tower is available in Reind. Instead of tower defense, the mod will emphasize unit defense. Most campaign sectors are no longer captured by surviving certain number of waves, but by producing something. </p>
<p> Since I'm solely working on the mod, Reind is expected to be WIP for a very long time. Maps in Reind are not generated since the complexity, do not launch to any numbered sectors! </p>
