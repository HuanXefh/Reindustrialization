# Reindustrialization

<br>I've seen too many contents bearing names from real life, with no relation to what they actually are. Somehow I began working on this mod to bring the concepts I've learned to Mindustry.

<br>Reind is not meant to be a typical mod focused on tower defense, instead there will be a hell amount of recipes based on real industrial processes.
<br>There are enemies. Instead of building towers, you have your units. This mod also adds some simple mechanisms, including pollution and corrosion. Theoretically nothing in vanilla campaign is changed.

<br>Reind is still imcomplete, I'm solely adding more contents to it.
<br>Important: Don't launch to numbered sectors!
